By this defintion of labor formed for collecting and recording information on labor in the United States in the 1900s it is clear by the
mentioning of "wage" and "industrial settings" that the metric began particularly as a way to measure the common American man's labor.

“The earliest labor statistics were designed to measure wages, hours, and employment
in industrial settings.”
— U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
