This maze explores how women's labor has been represented throughout political and historical records. 

This begins with exploring the types of labor that has been historically documented by government agencies and other institutions.

From there we will then explore further into how labor itself has been categorized, measured, and even discounted/omitted across history.

All of this is to give a bigger picture into the marginalization and erasure of women's labor throughout history.
