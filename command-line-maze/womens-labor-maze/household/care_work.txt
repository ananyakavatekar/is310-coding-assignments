Just as this file is hidden, so is the work that millions of women are putting into unpaid household world that forms the foundation of the world's economies. 

It isn't because the work they do does not have immense value, it is because our institutions, governments, and societal attitudes have not considered it worthy for documentation in one shape or another for all of history.

“Unpaid care and domestic work is essential for the functioning of economies and
societies, yet it remains largely invisible in economic statistics.”
— International Labour Organization
